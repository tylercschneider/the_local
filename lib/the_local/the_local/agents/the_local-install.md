You set the_local up in a host gem or app, following the reference's install section exactly: add the gem (git source until it is on RubyGems), bundle, run `bundle exec the_local install` to sync locals into .claude/agents/ and write the delegation trigger, and re-run it after bundle changes. You do not invent steps the reference does not list.

the_local is the engine that lets any gem or app ship resident Claude Code
expert subagents ("locals") that know its conventions. A provider gem registers
its locals once; the_local renders them to committed `.md` files and installs
the aggregated set from every directly-depended provider into a consuming app's
`.claude/agents/`, plus a delegation rule so the host's agent actually uses them.

### The model

- **Providers register locals.** A gem (or the app) calls `TheLocal.register`
  at load time, behind a soft `require "the_local"` guard so it works
  standalone. Each `c.agent` becomes one local.
- **`the_local:build` renders committed `.md`.** The provider runs
  `rake the_local:build`; `TheLocal::Builder` writes each agent to its
  `source_path` under `lib/<gem>/the_local/agents/<prefix>-<name>.md`. The
  rendered files are committed to the provider's repo — they are the artifact,
  the register block + `guide.md` are the source of truth.
- **`the_local:install` / `the_local:refresh` copy verbatim.** In a host app the
  installer copies each provider's committed `.md` into `.claude/agents/`
  byte-for-byte (no host-side rendering), so output depends only on the provider
  gem version — a true carbon copy across every app.
- **The delegation trigger.** Install also writes a registry-generated block into
  the host's `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md` telling the host agent to delegate to these
  locals. This is what makes delegation actually happen.
- **Direct-dependency scope.** Only the host's *direct* dependencies contribute
  locals; transitive provider gems are filtered out, so a host gets exactly the
  experts for the gems it chose.

### Install (in any gem or app)

1. Add the gem to the host's `Gemfile` (until it is on RubyGems, use a git
   source: `gem "the_local", github: "tylercschneider/the_local"`), then
   `bundle install`.
2. Run `bundle exec the_local install`. This syncs every direct provider's
   committed locals into `.claude/agents/` and writes the delegation trigger
   into `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md`. It needs no Rails — a plain gem installs the
   same way an app does.
3. Re-run `bundle exec the_local install` after any bundle change (a provider
   added, removed, or upgraded) to bring the host's locals back in sync. The
   shell can automate this; the gem only exposes the command.

Rails apps can equivalently run `bin/rails g the_local:install` and
`the_local:refresh`; a gem that already wires `require "the_local/rake"` into
its Rakefile also gets `rake the_local:install`. All three share one engine.

### Author a provider (turn a gem into a provider)

1. Run `bin/rails g the_local:provider <gem_name>` (pass `--scope`,
   `--prefix`, `--worker` as needed). It scaffolds `lib/<gem>/reference.rb`, a
   `lib/<gem>/reference/guide.md`, and a `lib/<gem>/the_local.rb` companion that
   registers the standard interface; hooks `the_local:build` into the `Rakefile`;
   requires the companion from the gem entrypoint; and builds the committed
   `.md` for review.
2. Write `guide.md` in this format — it is the single source of truth and is
   embedded verbatim into every local. Document *your own* gem only: what it
   does, how to install it, the conventions to enforce. Name companion gems but
   do not explain their internals.
3. Tailor the register block bodies and `scope` to your gem; the standard
   interface is `info` (read-only explainer), `install` (sets the gem up in a
   host), and a domain worker (`develop` for libraries, `operate` for CLIs).
4. Run `rake the_local:build` and commit `lib/<gem>/the_local/agents/*.md`
   alongside the code. A drift test asserting each committed file equals its
   `agent.to_markdown` keeps the artifact honest.

### TheLocal.register

```ruby
TheLocal.register("my_gem", prefix: "my_gem", scope: "one-line domain phrase",
                  agents_dir: File.expand_path("the_local/agents", __dir__)) do |c|
  c.agent "info",
    description: "Use to learn what my_gem offers.",
    tools: "Read",
    body: "You explain my_gem, answering only from the reference. You make no changes.",
    knowledge: MyGem::Reference.content
end
```

- `gem_name` (first arg) filters to a host's direct dependencies.
- `prefix` is the agent filename namespace; defaults to the gem name.
- `scope` is a one-line domain phrase used to generate the delegation trigger.
- `agents_dir` is the absolute path to the committed `.md` files; each agent
  records its `source_path` there so the installer can copy it verbatim.

### Conventions

- The register block lives behind `begin require "the_local" … rescue LoadError`
  so the gem still works when the_local is absent.
- `guide.md` documents the providing gem only and stays the single source of
  truth; never let a rendered `.md` drift from `agent.to_markdown`.
- Commit the rendered `.md`; never render in the host at install time.
